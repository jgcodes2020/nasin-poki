# nasin poki, a new input method for *sitelen pona*
There really aren't that many words in toki pona, but it is more than a few. Trying to assign [one key per letter](https://sona.pona.la/wiki/Sitelen_Pona_Keyboard_Layout) with two modifier keys is limited to 188 characters, and can get very messy and difficult to remember. Using a [shape-decomposition](https://sona.pona.la/wiki/Wakalito) system works well on mobile phones where space is at a premium, but becomes a bit cumbersome on desktop.

This IME assigns *two*-letter combinations to each word. The first letter corresponds to 1 of 24 *categories* (in toki pona: *poki*), and the second letter selects a particular word.

Less-common words can be accessed using `x` (like Cangjie) followed by two letters, once again with the first selecting a *poki*.
